# Info

## Title : Mailer

## Description : The purpose of this application is to provide a secure, comprehensive and fast package containing the functionality of sending emails.  During the development of my other projects, I noticed that I was missing a mailer with interface simple to use. Therefore, I decided to create this application. It includes 2 ways to send emails:
- API
- SMTP
Each way contains its own class with a common interface.
